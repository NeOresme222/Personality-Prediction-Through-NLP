# Personality-Prediction-Through-NLP

## Scope and Overview
  Can personality be predicted through Natural Language Processing (NLP)? This project endeavored to test the reliability of machine Learning (ML) models in cataloging and predicting Myers-Briggs (MB) personality types aacording to text.
    - The information used in this project was sourced from www.personalitycafe.com, a MB personality forum. 
    - The users sourced made their MB pesonalities public
    - 8,675 users populated the database. 
    - The last 50 posts were collected for each user to constitute the available NLP text. 

Based on Carl Jung's suppositions of the psyche, the MB personality classification system is largely discredited as a pseudoscience and concerns have been raised about conflicts of interest in the legitiamcy of research. However, it does overlap in some character trait identficiation metrics with the scientifically validated 'Big Five' (such as extroversion/introversion). What the MB system explicitly has going for it is its established popularity and ease of access, making it much more prolific in accessing data. 
In the MB system, there are four bimodal classifiers resulting in 16 distinct classifications. The 16 personalities are:

## Personality Distribution
  A dramatic disparity was observed between the personality distributions of the population and those found on PersonalityCafe (source https://www.careerplanner.com/MB2/TypeInPopulation.cfm). For example, while the four personalities ESTP, ESTJ, ESFP, ESFJ constitute 33.8% in the global population, only 2.5% was represented in the data.
